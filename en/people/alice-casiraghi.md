Growing up in a small town in the green Brianza area north of Milan, during the last intense five years the Far East is where I felt at home, in the human anthill cities of the ‘great dragon’, China. Being constantly in search of new challenges to wrap my mind around, in the latest years I have worked as a designer with the most diverse agencies and clients, geography and scope wise.

I obtained a double master degree in Product Service System Design at Politecnico of Milan and Tongji University in Shanghai. During the same years I graduated at Alta Scuola Politecnica of Milan and Turin Polytechnic University. And yet my favourite teacher is still the one from elementary school, Laura, who was the first to encourage my prolific drawing activity.

After my graduation in China I started working in Shanghai for Continuum as a service designer, then for Wilddesign, a German agency, helping European and American companies to enter the Asian market by understanding their sales and branding needs through field research, and finally for IBM iX, as a UX / UI designer, jumping onto new types of challenges and floating between a then familiar Shanghai and the claustrophobic but exciting Hong Kong.

From Hong Kong, I decided to push myself a little further down towards the equator, in Singapore. There I found an innovative and dynamic environment, where I founded my agency in 2018, deciding to focus my work on strategies for the transition of companies and administrations to a circular and regenerative economy. I share this adventure with an entrepreneur friend of mine, like me, she is passionate about complex ecosystems and crazy feats.

I have been following the Digital Team with enthusiasm since the dawn of the project. In May 2019, after more than two years from my first interview with them, I joined the team of experts with great enthusiasm. In the Team I mainly deal with digital service design, primarily the Public Administration and Services Portals for the IO project. Starting from the user experience analysis, I work at its graphic development and its functionalities.

In my free time I practice capoeira, to soothe body and mind, and I immerse myself in reading history books, articles and modern essays. As Achille Castiglioni used to say to his students: “If you’re not curious, forget about it. If you are not interested in others, what they do and how they behave, then being a designer is not for you”.
